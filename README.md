Project- Inventory Management System

Problem Statement: ​ Design a inventory management system , a database based
project, which will allow us to maintain the exact count of any product qualitatively and
quantitatively. ​ ​This system can widely be used by normal shops, departmental stores or
MNCs for keeping a proper track of the stock. It also consists of information like supplier
details, customer details etc.With the help of this system we can observe a minimum
quantity of any inventory below which we need to place an order for that inventory. This will
help us in good sales results and never be out of stock for any inventory.
